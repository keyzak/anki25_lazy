This project is designed to help me manage my Anki repetitions without letting them pile up. I was getting overwhelmed by the growing number of words I had to review each day, especially when I didn't open the app for a while. To solve this, I created this tool to automate the syncing of my Anki deck. It allows me to update my progress and keep track of my daily repetitions at a manageable level.

In this project, I'm using Selenium to interact with Anki Web. The tool opens a specific deck using XPath, a way to find elements on a webpage. Currently, I'm using //div[15]/div[1]/button to find the deck, but this is not the most reliable solution. It depends on the layout of the page, which could change. A better approach would be to use the deck's name to make the XPath more precise, but for now, this method works.
